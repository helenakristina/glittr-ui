## Glittr

Glittr is an idea created by a team of female engineers and designers, brought together by Women Hack the Crisis. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, parents are struggling to make ends meet for their families, and children have a lot of energy that can create additional stress during already difficult times. Our goal is to create a wellness platform for children to learn, express and release their creativity with others while maintaining social distancing.

Women Hack The Crisis was a week-long hackathon in May of 2020. In this week, the team brainstormed, designed, and developed a prototype. After the hackathon, we decided to continue meeting and take Glittr on as a side project. It is currently in the early development stages, though we intend to build a full functioning platform.

## Future Features

- Glittr will eventually embed video content into the site, allowing the children to watch a video and complete an exercise within the application.
- We are also working on implementing a canvas, that will allow users to respond to a prompt with a drawing. This would require some machine learning to ensure that the drawings displayed are appropriate.
